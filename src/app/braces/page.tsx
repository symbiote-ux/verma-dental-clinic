        <h2>Various Types of Braces</h2>

        <h3>Metal Braces</h3>
        <p>
          Metal braces are what everyone typically thinks of when they think of
          braces. They are metal brackets made of high-grade stainless steel
          that are attached to the teeth and usually held into place with
          elastic bands.
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most cost-effective option of all tooth straightening
            treatments.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bands come in a variety of colors to help you express your
            personality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They are unattractive and can make the wearer feel less confident.
          </li>
          <li>They can irritate the gums.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ceramic Braces</h3>
        <p>
          Ceramic braces are a form of conventional orthodontic appliance made
          up of brackets bonded to your individual teeth and an archwire that
          runs across them. Their fundamental difference lies in the fact that
          the bracket used is made out of a tooth-colored ceramic compound
          instead of metal.
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They have smaller bracket designs than traditional metal braces.
          </li>
          <li>They are almost invisible from a distance or in photographs.</li>
          <li>They are more comfortable than traditional metal braces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Self-Ligating Braces</h3>
        <p>
          Self-ligating braces are one of the innovative options available at
          our center. They eliminate the need for ties and let the archwire move
          smoothly through the brackets.
        </p>
        <h4>Benefits of Self-Ligating Braces:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fewer appointments needed to apply braces or make adjustments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased comfort because of low-profile brackets and no ties.
          </li>
          <li>Efficient tooth movement for shorter treatment time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Aligners</h2>
        <p>
          The Invisalign system is a virtually invisible treatment that uses an
          innovative approach to gently yet effectively straighten your teeth.
          Through a series of custom-made removable aligners made with unique
          Smart Force technology, the Invisalign system gradually and
          predictably moves your teeth to an ideal position.

        <h2>How do Braces Affect What a Person Can or Cannot Eat?</h2>
        <p>
          To make the most of your treatment, it's important that you follow
          your orthodontist's recommendations. Avoid sticky foods like caramel,
          gum, and taffy, plus crunchy foods like corn chips, popcorn, and nuts.
          Don't chew ice cubes! Hard vegetables and fruits like carrots and
          apples should be cut into bite-size pieces.

        <h2>How do I Take Care of My Braces?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whatever type of braces you wear, take extra time for oral health
            care. The goal is to remove plaque from around the teeth and gums.
          </li>
          <li>
            When brushing at least twice a day, make sure you reach all surfaces
            around the braces.
          </li>
          <li>Oral irrigators can help to remove food debris.</li>
          <li>
            Mouth rinses can be used to help reduce the level of bacteria around
            the teeth.
          </li>
